# Comment-App

This Comments App is a streamlined platform that allows users to view comments fetched from an external API while managing user authentication and display settings via Firebase. The app offers a secure and simple login/registration system using Firebase Authentication (email-only) and stores user information (name and email) in Firestore. Users can view comments in a clean, organized layout, which includes the commenter's name, email, and comment body.

A key feature is the integration with Firebase Remote Config, which dynamically controls whether to display the full email address or mask part of it for privacy. The app's design is intuitive, featuring user profile icons with the initial letter of their name inside a CircleAvatar. With an elegant UI built on Flutter, the app ensures a seamless and secure user experience.
